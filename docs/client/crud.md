# CRUD

This page describes how to perform CRUD operations with your generated Prisma Client API. CRUD is an acronym that stands for:

- [Create](#create)
- [Read](#read)
- [Update](#update)
- [Delete](#delete)

Refer to the [Prisma Client reference documentation](../references/prisma-client-reference.md) for a complete list of all available methods.

## Example schema and provider

All examples are based on the following Prisma schema:

::: details Expand to view the schema (`schema.prisma`)

<<< @/../example/prisma/schema.prisma

:::

::: details Expand to view the provider (`prisma.dart`)
<<< @/../example/prisma.dart
:::

## Create

### Create a single record

The following query creates (`create`) a single record of the `User` model with two fields:

<<< @/../example/crud/create_single_record.dart#snippet

::: details show query results

```
{id: 1, email: seven@odroe.com, name: Seven Du, role: USER}
```

:::

The user's `id` is automatically generated by the database.

### Create multiple records

The following `createMany` query creates multiple users and skips any duplicates ( `email`` must be unique):

<<< @/../example/crud/create_multiple_records.dart#snippet

::: details show query results

```
{count: 3}
```

:::

::: tip

The `skipDuplicates` is not support when using **MongoDB** and **SQL Server**.

:::

### Create records and connect or create related records

See [Related queries -> Nested writes](./related-queries#nested-writes) for information about creating a record and one or more related at the same time.

## Read

### Get record by ID or unique field

The following queries return a single record (`findUnique`) by ID or unique field:

::: code-group

<<< @/../example/crud/get_record_by_id.dart#snippet
<<< @/../example/crud/get_record_by_unique_field.dart#snippet

:::

## Update

## Delete
