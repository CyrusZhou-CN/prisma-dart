## What is Prisma Client Dart?

Prisma Client Dart is a Dart ORM that is published on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/orm) with the package name `orm`.
It uses [Prisma Engine](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines) as the data access layer and tries to keep the API as consistent as possible with [Prisma JS/TS Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client).

::: details Why Prisma Client Dart package name is `orm`?

Because the package name `prisma` has been occupied, and the package has not been widely used and the author is no longer updating it.
When we released Prisma Dart Client, we contacted the author of the `prisma` package, but did not get a reply.
