### Major improvements:

### All packages merged into one

We have reasonably integrated all the packages we split before, before:
```yaml
dependencies:
   orm: 1.0.0
dev_dependencies:
   prisma_cli: 1.0.0
```
Now:
```yaml
dependencies:
   orm: 2.0.0
```

### Support transactions (preview)

Interactive transactions are a stable feature in Prisma For Dart, but a preview feature for the Prisma engine.
Interactive transactions are easier to handle for ORMs:

```dart
final result = await prisma.$transaction((prisma) async {
   final user = await prisma.user.create(...);
   final post = await prisma.post.create(...);

   return post;
}
```

### CLI

- Added `db pull` function
- Complete refactoring of `generate` command
- Built-in RPC engine service refactoring
- The binary download engine supports the verification version, and the marked version will be downloaded automatically when the engine is updated

### Runtime

- Added GraphQL SDL generation
- Added `prisma.$connect()` method
- Added `prisma.$disconnect()` method
- Refactored engine interface and entry parameters
