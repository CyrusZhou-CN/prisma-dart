### Major improvements:

### All packages merged into one

We have reasonably integrated all the packages we split before, before:
```yaml
dependencies:
   orm: 1.0.0
dev_dependencies:
   prisma_cli: 1.0.0
```

### Support transactions (preview)

Interactive transactions are a stable feature in Prisma For Dart, but a preview feature for the Prisma engine.
Interactive transactions are easier to handle for ORMs:

````dart
final result = prisma.$transaction((prisma) async {
   final user = await prisma.user.create({
     data: {
       name: 'Odore',
     },
   });
   final post = await prisma.post.create({
     data: {
       title: 'My first post',
       content: 'This is my first post',
       author: {
         connect: {
           id: user.id,
         },
       },
     },
   });

   return post;
}
````
