Prisma Client Dart is an auto-generated type-safe ORM. It uses Prisma Engine as the data access layer and is as consistent as possible with the Prisma Prisma Client JS/TS APIs.

üëâ [Learn how to use Prisma ORM for Dart in your project](https://prisma.pub/).

```dart
import 'package:orm/orm.dart';

final client = PrismaClient();

main() {
  final users = await client.user.findMany();
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Prisma Client Dart is an open source project developed and maintained by [Seven Du](https://github.com/medz), which allows you to use Prisma ORM in the Dart language. **Prisma is Next-generation Node.js and TypeScript ORM**.
>
> If your back-end project uses Node.js or Bun.js, it is highly recommended that you take a look üëâ [Prisma ORM Official](https://prisma.io/)
>
> Other language implementations in community üëâ [Prisma Ecosystem](https://www.prisma.io/ecosystem/).
