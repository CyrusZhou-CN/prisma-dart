Prisma Client Dart is an auto-generated type-safe ORM. It uses Prisma Engine as the data access layer and is as consistent as possible with the Prisma Client JS/TS APIs.

üëâ [Learn how to use Prisma ORM for Dart in your project](https://prisma.pub/).

```dart
import 'package:orm/orm.dart';

final client = PrismaClient();

main() {
  final users = await client.user.findMany();
}
```

## Installation

This will add a like this to you packages `pubspec.yaml` (and run an implicit `dart pub get`):

```yaml
dependencies:
  orm: latest
```

Or you can run the following command:

```sh
dart pub add orm
```
